# Graph-in-Deep-Learning
 Some of my knowledge about Graphs and Graph Neural Network (with some of my projects which will be updated later).
 And also, my answers for CS224W - Machine Learning with Graphs course, Stanford University

 Using networkx for implementation

 ```
 pip install networkx
```
